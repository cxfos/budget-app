# Design Improvement Progress (as of IDE update)

## What is done:
- All major frontend functionality issues are fixed and committed.
- Design audit checklist and design instructions are documented in `.ai-docs`.
- Tailwind color palette and font family (Inter, Roboto) are set up in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Google Fonts are imported in `index.html`.
- Global CSS (`index.css`) applies the new font and background color using Tailwind classes.
- Documentation for the design foundation is in `.ai-docs/design-foundation.md`.
- Navigation component created with modern design and responsive layout.
- Layout component implemented to provide consistent structure across pages.
- Login and Register pages updated with new design tokens and improved UX.
- Dashboard page updated to use the new layout and design tokens.
- **LandingPage redesigned with a modern, compelling hero, features, personal story, login link, and 'buy me a drink' placeholder.**
