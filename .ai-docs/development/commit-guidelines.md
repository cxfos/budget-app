# Commit Message Guidelines

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Short**: Keep messages concise and to the point
2. **Sweet**: Be clear and friendly in tone
3. **Present Tense**: Use present tense for all commit messages
4. **Capital First Letter**: Always start commit messages with a capital letter

## 📝 Format

```
<Description>
```

## ✅ Good Examples

- `Add user authentication`
- `Fix login form validation`
- `Update README with new features`
- `Format code according to style guide`
- `Simplify expense calculation logic`
- `Add unit tests for budget calculator`
- `Update dependencies`

## ❌ Bad Examples

- ~~`fixed the bug in login`~~ (lowercase first letter)
- ~~`adding new feature for user auth`~~ (lowercase first letter)
- ~~`updated the documentation`~~ (past tense)
- ~~`WIP: working on something`~~ (unclear what was done)
- ~~`fix stuff`~~ (too vague)

## 💡 Tips

1. Keep the message under 50 characters
2. Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
3. Be specific about what changed
4. Reference issue numbers when applicable
5. Start with a capital letter
