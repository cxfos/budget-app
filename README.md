# ðŸ“‹ Budgeting App (Go + Fiber + PostgreSQL + React)

A full-stack budgeting application built with Go (backend), React (frontend), and PostgreSQL. This MVP allows users to register, log in, add expenses, and view their total spending per cycle.

## Technologies

- Backend: Go, Fiber
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript, Vite
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT
- Deployment: Docker containers

## Features

- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- CRUD operations for expenses
- Endpoint to retrieve expenses for a specific cycle
- Endpoint to get total sum of expenses for the current cycle
- Modern and responsive user interface
- Real-time expense tracking

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.21 or later (for local development)
- Node.js 20 or later (for local development)
- PostgreSQL 15 or later (for local development)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cxfos/budget-app.git
   cd budget-app
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your configuration.

## Running the Application

### Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker Compose, which will set up all services (frontend, backend, and database) automatically:

1. Build and start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:80
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080
   - Database: localhost:5432

### Local Development

#### Backend

1. Start PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   docker compose up db
   ```

2. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d budget_app -f migrations/001_init.sql
   ```

3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go run cmd/api/main.go
   ```

#### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

- `POST /api/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/login` - Login and get JWT token

### Protected Endpoints (require JWT token)

- `POST /api/expenses` - Create a new expense
- `GET /api/expenses` - List all expenses
- `GET /api/expenses/total` - Get total expenses for a period
- `PUT /api/expenses/:id` - Update an expense
- `DELETE /api/expenses/:id` - Delete an expense
